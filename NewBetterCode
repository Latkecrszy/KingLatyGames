retching sound outside. You open the window and you see a man walking around on the street. You close the window
just in time to hear a scream outside. You open the window again, and the first man is grabbing another person
by the head and ripping his head off. You start to feel dizzy. You think you're imagining things, but you hear
a chorus of howling nearby. You step into the balcony of your home, bathed in
moonlight, just in time to see a horde of zombies running down the road towards your apartment building. You
see them enter the lobby, and you hear another scream. The lady at the front desk has mutated into a zombie as
well. What do you do?
